1. Structures 
2. Class - Data + Functions
3. OOPS - (Modelling real world problems, data is critical element)
4. Features - Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance
5. Encapsulation - Binding together data elements and functions
6. Polymorphism - Ability of an object/entity to take multiple forms (Compile time, Runtime Polymorphism)
7. Abstraction - Showing necessary details by background implementation
8. Inheritance - Using already existing functions and data from other class (reusability)
                 Types - Single, Multi-level, Multiple, Hierarchical and Hybrid inheritance
