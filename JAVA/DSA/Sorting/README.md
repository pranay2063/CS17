**Quick Sort**
1. Worst case of quick sort - *O(n^2)* when array is sorted or all elements are equal
2. Can worst case of quick sort be avoided? Yes - *https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/can-quicksort-implemented-onlogn-worst-case-time-complexity/*
3. Lomuto partition and Hoare partition algorithms - *https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hoares-vs-lomuto-partition-scheme-quicksort/*
4. Randomized quick sort - Best case is *O(n)*
5. Is quick sort stable? No - *https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1278243/stability-of-quicksort-partitioning-approach*
6. Why is quick sort faster than merge sort in general? - *https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/*
7. Why is Quick Sort preferred for Arrays and Merge Sort for Linked Lists? - *https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-quick-sort-preferred-for-arrays-and-merge-sort-for-linked-lists/*

**Heapsort**
1. Is it stable? No
2. Is it in-place? Yes
3. Time complexity - *https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9755721/how-can-building-a-heap-be-on-time-complexity*
