**Quick Sort**
1. Worst case of quick sort - O(N^2) when array is sorted or all elements are equal
2. Can worst case of quick sort be avoided? Yes - *https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/can-quicksort-implemented-onlogn-worst-case-time-complexity/*
3. Lomuto partition and Hoare partition algorithms - *https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hoares-vs-lomuto-partition-scheme-quicksort/*
4. Randomized quick sort - Best case is O(N)
5. Is quick sort stable? No - *https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1278243/stability-of-quicksort-partitioning-approach*
6. Why is quick sort faster than merge sort in general? - *https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/*

**Heapsort**
1. Is it stable? No
2. Is it in-place? Yes
